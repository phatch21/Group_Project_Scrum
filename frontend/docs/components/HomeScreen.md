# HomeScreen Component

The `HomeScreen` component is the main UI element of the application, displaying a stylish home screen with a goals tracking section.

## Overview

The HomeScreen component is designed to provide a clean, modern interface for users to view their goals. It's fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Component Structure

```

```

## Props

The HomeScreen component currently doesn't accept any props, as it's designed to be a standalone view. Future versions may include props for customizing the goals and other elements.

## Styling

The component uses a dedicated CSS file (`HomeScreen.css`) with responsive styles that adapt to different screen sizes. Key style features include:

- Responsive layout that adjusts to screen width
- Mobile-optimized spacing and dimensions
- Proper handling of different aspect ratios
- Adaptive font sizes

## Mobile Responsiveness

The component includes specific optimizations for mobile devices:

- For screens under 480px width:
  - Container width adjusts to 100% of viewport
  - Font sizes are reduced for better readability
  - Spacing is adjusted for touch-friendly interaction
  - Aspect ratio handling is modified to work better on mobile screens

## Usage Example

```jsx
import HomeScreen from "./components/HomeScreen";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app-container">
      <HomeScreen />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for this component include:

1. Adding props to customize goals
2. Implementing interactive goal tracking functionality
3. Adding animations for a more engaging user experience
4. Supporting theme customization
